해결 방법



I found a solution

That is to disable the hardware acceleration

This is done by using the file manager in the "View" tab, click the option "Show Hidden Files", you should then see a folder called ".vscode"

And in that folder is a file called "argv.json". You can edit this file with any file editor or other IDE. I used Geany. I uncommented the line where it said ""disable-hardware-acceleration": true,". Save, then in the terminal, type "code"

It should now run to the splash screen of the release notes, and work normally

Don't forget to hide the folder and files again
